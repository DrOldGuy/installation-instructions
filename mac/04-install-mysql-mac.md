# Install MySQL on the Mac

## MacOS Monterey

1. Navigate to the MySQL Community Edition download page: [https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/). Select MacOS in the Operating System dropdown. 
2. Select the correct version of MySQL for your operating system (i.e., macOS 12 (x86, 64-bit), DMG Archive).

## Older MacOS versions

1. Navigate to the MySQL Community Edition archives page: [https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/](https://downloads.mysql.com/archives/community/). Select MacOS as the Operating System. Select an older version of MySQL until you see your MacOS version in the list of installs. For example, selecting MySQL version 8.0.20 displays DMG archives for MacOS version 10.15.
2. Select the correct version of MySQL for your operating system (i.e., MacOS 10.15 (x86, 64-bit).

1. Once you find the correct download version, click the Download button next to the selection. You will see a login page. Click on "No thanks, just start my download".
2. When the download has finished, open the download in the Finder. Right-click on the .pkg file and select Open. If you get a message saying the archive can't be verified, click Allow. If you get a message saying that the package will determine if it can be installed, click Allow.
3. When the installer appears, click Continue.
4. Accept the license agreement.
5. Click Install. You have an option to change the installation directory and to customize the installation, but on my version, neither of these options worked.
6. You will need to supply your password and create a root password for MySQL.
